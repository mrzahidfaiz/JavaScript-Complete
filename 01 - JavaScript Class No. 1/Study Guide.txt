Exection -Contaxt has 2 

1) Memory it has key: value
2) Code it has code for execution line by line without skip any line


1) Memory i.e let var = a and fn: (){}
2) Execute code 

Summary of this video - As we have already discussed in the last video that everything happens in javascript in the execution environment. So the entire execution happens in two phases as follows
1. Memory allocation phase- all the variables  and functions get their memory allocated in the memory with undefined and the entire code  respectively. 
2. Code execution phase - in this phase  thread execution happens and all the variables get their actual values which were assigned to them and as function is invoked, a new execution environment gets created in the code part, and again there are two phases, memory allocation phase and code execution phase. And the cycle repeats.
